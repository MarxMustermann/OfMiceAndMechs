# OfMiceAndMechs

Explore an abandoned world and subjugate it!

OfMiceAndMechs merges multiple gameplay types into one:

* Roguelikes: You walk around, explore dungeons and fight enemies to get new loot.
* Base Management: You have a base with workers to manage and you can expand it by adding more rooms.
* Tower defence: Build traps and defend you base against raiders
* Automation: You can design new rooms with traps and production machinery

This combines to something like:

Design a new production room, task workers with building it, grab some locally produced ammo and head into a dungeon to get some rare items you can't produce yourself.

# try it!

There is story guiding you through the games systems, essentially step by step if you need it.
If you don't need the help you can ignore the story or increase the difficulty.

So [download](INSTALL.md) the game and try it today.
