# OfMiceAndMechs

Explore an abandoned world and subjugate it!

OfMiceAndMechs merges multiple gameplay types into one:

* You walk around, explore dungeons and fight enemies to get new loot.
* You have a base with workers to manage and you can expand it by adding more rooms.
* you can design new rooms with traps and production machinery

This combines to something like:

Design a new production room, task workers with building it, grab some ammo and head into a dungeon to get some rare items you can't produce yourself.

# try it!

There is an extensive help system, to get you started.
