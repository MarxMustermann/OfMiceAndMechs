To clean simply pick up items from the walkways.
When your inventory is full put the collected items into storage.

* cluttered trap rooms do not work properly
This is because the enemies need to step on the electrified floor.
Items lying on the floor prevent that.

* the ghoul automation might break.
This is because the ghouls can collide with items and get disoriented.

* entry to and passage through rooms might not be possible
