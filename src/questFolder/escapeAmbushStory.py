You reach out to your implant and it answers.
It whispers, but you understand clearly:


This room is not a safe place to stay.
Enemies are on their way to hunt you down.
They look like [- and come from """+enemyDirection+""".

So get moving and leave this room.
Use the wasd movement keys to move.
Pass through the door (""",door.render(),""") in the """+self.direction+""".



Right now you are looking at the quest menu.
