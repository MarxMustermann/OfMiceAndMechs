There is no commander. This is a problem.

Insects are growing within the hives in the abandoned farms.
Without a commander the hives will continue growing.
Sooner or later their attacks will break the bases defenses.

Also the base is in maintenance mode.
So leaving is not an option. You are stuck here.
It is not safe here, but it is safer in the base than outside.

So stay here until those issues are resolved.
Join the crew of this base and help defend it against the insects.
The harder you work the safer you will be."""
